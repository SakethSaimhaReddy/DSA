## Data Structures

### Arrays

- [Dynamic Array](./data_structures/arrays/dynamic_array.py) - implementation of a dynamic array that automatically resizes as needed.
- [Static Array](./data_structures/arrays/static_array.py) - implementation of a static array that has a fixed size.
- [Array List](./data_structures/arrays/array_list.py) - implementation of an array list that allows for constant time random access and efficient insertion/deletion at the end.

### Linked Lists

- [Singly Linked List](./data_structures/linked_lists/singly_linked_list.py) - implementation of a singly linked list that allows for efficient insertion/deletion at the beginning and end.
- [Doubly Linked List](./data_structures/linked_lists/doubly_linked_list.py) - implementation of a doubly linked list that allows for efficient insertion/deletion at the beginning and end, as well as traversal in both directions.

### Stacks

- [Stack](./data_structures/stacks/stack.py) - implementation of a stack that follows the LIFO (last-in, first-out) principle.

### Queues

- [Queue](./data_structures/queues/queue.py) - implementation of a queue that follows the FIFO (first-in, first-out) principle.
- [Priority Queue](./data_structures/queues/priority_queue.py) - implementation of a priority queue that orders elements by their priority.

### Trees

- [Binary Search Tree](./data_structures/trees/binary_search_tree.py) - implementation of a binary search tree that maintains the order of elements for efficient searching.
- [AVL Tree](./data_structures/trees/avl_tree.py) - implementation of an AVL tree that maintains balance to ensure efficient insertion/deletion and searching.

### Graphs

- [Graph](./data_structures/graphs/graph.py) - implementation of a graph data structure that can be used to represent networks, maps, and other complex systems.

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms

- [Bubble Sort](./algorithms/sorting/bubble_sort.py) - implementation of the bubble sort algorithm for sorting arrays.
- [Insertion Sort](./algorithms/sorting/insertion_sort.py) - implementation of the insertion sort algorithm for sorting arrays.
- [Selection Sort](./algorithms/sorting/selection_sort.py) - implementation of the selection sort algorithm for sorting arrays.
- [Merge Sort](./algorithms/sorting/merge_sort.py) - implementation of the merge sort algorithm for sorting arrays.
- [Quick Sort](./algorithms/sorting/quick_sort.py) - implementation of the quick sort algorithm for sorting arrays.

### Searching Algorithms

- [Binary Search](./algorithms/searching/binary_search.py) - implementation of the binary search algorithm for searching a sorted array.

### Graph Algorithms

- [Depth-First Search](./algorithms/graphs/depth_first_search.py) - implementation of the depth-first search algorithm for travers
